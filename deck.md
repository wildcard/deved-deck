WIIFM is teaching someone else the ultimate way of learning.

Kent C Dodds like to describe the process of learning:
1. Consume
2. Build
3. Teach

To grow and improve, I naturally should help others learn by sharing my knowledge and teaching others.

I’m in the middle of it. I help teach the teachers.
